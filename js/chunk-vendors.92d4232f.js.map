Each service method that kicks off a request\n * returns an `AWS.Request` object that you can use to register\n * callbacks.\n *\n * For example, the following service method returns the request\n * object as \"request\", which can be used to register callbacks:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * // request is an AWS.Request object\n * var request = ec2.describeInstances();\n *\n * // register callbacks on request to retrieve response data\n * request.on('success', function(response) {\n *   console.log(response.data);\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * When a request is ready to be sent, the {send} method should\n * be called:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * request.send();\n * ```\n *\n * Since registered callbacks may or may not be idempotent, requests should only\n * be sent once. To perform the same operation multiple times, you will need to\n * create multiple request objects, each with its own registered callbacks.\n *\n * ## Removing Default Listeners for Events\n *\n * Request objects are built with default listeners for the various events,\n * depending on the service type. In some cases, you may want to remove\n * some built-in listeners to customize behaviour. Doing this requires\n * access to the built-in listener functions, which are exposed through\n * the {AWS.EventListeners.Core} namespace. For instance, you may\n * want to customize the HTTP handler used when sending a request. In this\n * case, you can remove the built-in listener associated with the 'send'\n * event, the {AWS.EventListeners.Core.SEND} listener and add your own.\n *\n * ## Multiple Callbacks and Chaining\n *\n * You can register multiple callbacks on any request object. The\n * callbacks can be registered for different events, or all for the\n * same event. In addition, you can chain callback registration, for\n * example:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * request.\n *   on('success', function(response) {\n *     console.log(\"Success!\");\n *   }).\n *   on('error', function(error, response) {\n *     console.log(\"Error!\");\n *   }).\n *   on('complete', function(response) {\n *     console.log(\"Always!\");\n *   }).\n *   send();\n * ```\n *\n * The above example will print either \"Success! Always!\", or \"Error! Always!\",\n * depending on whether the request succeeded or not.\n *\n * @!attribute httpRequest\n *   @readonly\n *   @!group HTTP Properties\n *   @return [AWS.HttpRequest] the raw HTTP request object\n *     containing request headers and body information\n *     sent by the service.\n *\n * @!attribute startTime\n *   @readonly\n *   @!group Operation Properties\n *   @return [Date] the time that the request started\n *\n * @!group Request Building Events\n *\n * @!event validate(request)\n *   Triggered when a request is being validated.

service.\n *\n * By default this provider gets credentials using the\n * {AWS.CognitoIdentity.getCredentialsForIdentity} service operation, which\n * requires either an `IdentityId` or an `IdentityPoolId` (Amazon Cognito\n * Identity Pool ID), which is used to call {AWS.CognitoIdentity.getId} to\n * obtain an `IdentityId`. If the identity or identity pool is not configured in\n * the Amazon Cognito Console to use IAM roles with the appropriate permissions,\n * then additionally a `RoleArn` is required containing the ARN of the IAM trust\n * policy for the Amazon Cognito role that the user will log into. If a `RoleArn`\n * is provided, then this provider gets credentials using the\n * {AWS.STS.assumeRoleWithWebIdentity} service operation, after first getting an\n * Open ID token from {AWS.CognitoIdentity.getOpenIdToken}.\n *\n * In addition, if this credential provider is used to provide authenticated\n * login, the `Logins` map may be set to the tokens provided by the respective\n * identity providers. See {constructor} for an example on creating a credentials\n * object with proper property values.\n *\n * ## Refreshing Credentials from Identity Service\n *\n * In addition to AWS credentials expiring after a given amount of time, the\n * login token from the identity provider will also expire. Once this token\n * expires, it will not be usable to refresh AWS credentials, and another\n * token will be needed. The SDK does not manage refreshing of the token value,\n * but this can be done through a \"refresh token\" supported by most identity\n * providers. Consult the documentation for the identity provider for refreshing\n * tokens. Once the refreshed token is acquired, you should make sure to update\n * this new token in the credentials object's {params} property. The following\n * code will update the WebIdentityToken, assuming you have retrieved an updated\n * token from the identity provider:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * AWS.config.credentials.params.Logins['graph.facebook.com'] = updatedToken;\n * ```\n *\n * Future calls to `credentials.refresh()` will now use the new token.\n *\n * @!attribute params\n *   @return [map] the map of params passed to\n *     {AWS.CognitoIdentity.getId},\n *     {AWS.CognitoIdentity.getOpenIdToken}, and\n *     {AWS.STS.assumeRoleWithWebIdentity}.

Without any\n * extra parameters, credentials will be fetched from the\n * {AWS.STS.getSessionToken} operation. If an IAM role is provided, the\n * {AWS.STS.assumeRole} operation will be used to fetch credentials for the\n * role instead.\n *\n * AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials differs from AWS.TemporaryCredentials in\n * the way masterCredentials and refreshes are handled.\n * AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials refreshes expired credentials using the\n * masterCredentials passed by the user to support chaining of STS credentials.\n * However, AWS.TemporaryCredentials recursively collapses the masterCredentials\n * during instantiation, precluding the ability to refresh credentials which\n * require intermediate, temporary credentials.\n *\n * For example, if the application should use RoleA, which must be assumed from\n * RoleB, and the environment provides credentials which can assume RoleB, then\n * AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials must be used to support refreshing the\n * temporary credentials for RoleA:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * var roleACreds = new AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials({\n *   params: {RoleArn: 'RoleA'},\n *   masterCredentials: new AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials({\n *     params: {RoleArn: 'RoleB'},\n *     masterCredentials: new AWS.EnvironmentCredentials('AWS')\n *   })\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * If AWS.TemporaryCredentials had been used in the previous example,\n * `roleACreds` would fail to refresh because `roleACreds` would\n * use the environment credentials for the AssumeRole request.\n *\n * Another difference is that AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials creates the STS\n * service instance during instantiation while AWS.TemporaryCredentials creates\n * the STS service instance during the first refresh. Creating the service\n * instance during instantiation effectively captures the master credentials\n * from the global config, so that subsequent changes to the global config do\n * not affect the master credentials used to refresh the temporary credentials.\n *\n * This allows an instance of AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials to be assigned\n * to AWS.config.credentials:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * var envCreds = new AWS.EnvironmentCredentials('AWS');\n * AWS.config.credentials = envCreds;\n * // masterCredentials will be envCreds\n * AWS.config.credentials = new AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials({\n *   params: {RoleArn: '...'}\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * Similarly, to use the CredentialProviderChain's default providers as the\n * master credentials, simply create a new instance of\n * AWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * AWS.config.credentials = new ChainableTemporaryCredentials({\n *   params: {RoleArn: '...'}\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * @!attribute service\n *   @return [AWS.STS] the STS service instance used to\n *     get and refresh temporary credentials from AWS STS.\n * @note (see constructor)\n */\nAWS.ChainableTemporaryCredentials = AWS.util.inherit(AWS.Credentials, {\n  /**\n   * Creates a new temporary credentials object.\n   *\n   * @param options [map] a set of options\n   * @option options params [map] ({}) a map of options that are passed to the\n   *   {AWS.STS.assumeRole} or {AWS.STS.getSessionToken} operations.\n   *   If a `RoleArn` parameter is passed in, credentials will be based on the\n   *   IAM role.
